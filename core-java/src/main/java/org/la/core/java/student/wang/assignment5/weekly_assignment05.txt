		Suppose given array is [10, 19, 2, 7] -> number of 1's here zero
		Suppose given array is [1, 19, 1, 7, 1, 3] -> number of 1's here 3
	48)	wap to count all 2's of an int array
		Suppose given array is [10, 19, 2, 7] -> number of 2's here one
		Suppose given array is [1, 19, 1, 7, 1, 3] -> number of 2's here 0
	49)	what ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ?	- theory, search in google
	50)	wap to find the largest and smallest number in an integer array

		Suppose given array is [10, 19, 2, 7] -> sum=38 is not a prime number
		Suppose given array is [10, 8, 2, 9] -> sum=29 is a prime number
	53)	wap to find whether an array of characters having 'a' or not?
		Suppose given array is ['a', '5', '7', 'p'] -> this array has 'a'
		Suppose given array is ['A', '5', '7', 'p'] -> this array doesn't have 'a'
	54)	wap to find whether an array of characters having 'Z' or not?
		Suppose given array is ['a', '5', '7', 'p'] -> this array doesn't have 'Z'
		Suppose given array is ['A', '5', 'Z', 'p'] -> this array has 'Z'
