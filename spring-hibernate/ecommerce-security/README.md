# ecommerce-security

I am trying to create number of different modules of rest apis where this rest api only take care of security and registration etc part.

other modules/rest apis will be secured by this rest api.

I want to create 

notification module

report module

scheduler module

document module

mysql module

security module

all these modules weill be consists of various rest apis and will interact with each other.

I will share jwt and each module first verify that jwt and will allow to access services.
